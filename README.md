# Pkgup

A simple Crystal CLI tool to update system packages and Flatpak apps on Debian-based Linux systems.  
Automatically detects whether to use `doas` or `sudo` for privilege escalation, and prefers `nala` if installed, falling back to `apt`.

## Features

- Update system packages (`apt` or `nala`)
- Update Flatpak applications
- Choose to update system packages, Flatpak, or both
- Uses `doas` if available, otherwise `sudo`

## Requirements

- Crystal programming language installed (for building from source)
- Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Optional: `doas` or `sudo`
- Optional: `nala` package manager
- Flatpak installed (if updating Flatpak apps)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `pkgup.cr` file.

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   crystal build pkgup.cr --release -o pkgup
   ```

3. (Optional) Move the executable to a directory in your PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv pkgup /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
./pkgup
```

You will be prompted to select which updates to perform:

```
Would you like to update [sys]pkgs, [flatpak]pkgs, or [both]:
```

Enter one of:

- `sys` â€” update system packages only
- `flatpak` â€” update Flatpak applications only
- `both` â€” update both system packages and Flatpak apps

## Example

```bash
$ ./pkgup
Would you like to update [sys]pkgs, [flatpak]pkgs, or [both]: sys
Updating System Programs...
System update complete!
```
